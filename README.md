# The-Fight-Against-Invasive-Goldfish
Invasive goldfish produce terrifying problems for native fish populations. Often dumped into bodies of water by humans, these goldfish uproot plant habitats, consume the eggs of native fish, and compete for often scarce resources. Even worse, female goldfish can reproduce rapidly, and without a male goldfish. This has led to notable problems in places like the Great Lakes, where millions of invasive Goldfish ravage ecosystems. This project uses multiple features such as goldfish length, weight, water pH, habitat, etc. to predict the lifespan of a Comet Goldfish. By inputting even a handful of these features you can predict the lifespan of goldfish, which could help to model population growth of these invasive populations. Stocking agencies at the state and national level can therefore take appropriate stocking measures for natural predators of these pest. While this approach is certainly not comprehensive, I hope it can offer potential solutions for our beautiful aquatic ecosystems.
