# Combatting-Goldfish-Lifespan-Variability
Comet Goldfish are ideal beginner pets, and a beloved species for companionship. Unfortunately, estimates for Comet Goldfish lifespans range anywhere from 5 to 20 years, with the oldest Comet Goldfish living for 43 years! This variance in estimates often leads to apprehension in buying these pets, or serious grief. I built this application to provide more definite life span predictions and solve both of these issues. Knowing how much time you have with your pet overcomes apprehension about buying one and provides anticipatory grief, a solid coping strategy. While Comet Goldfish lifespans are still incredibly volatile, I hope this project offers more concrete estimates.
