# Combatting-Goldfish-Lifespan-Variability
Comet Goldfish are ideal beginner pets, and a beloved species for companionship. Unfortunately, estimates for Comet Goldfish lifespans range anywhere from 5 to 20 years, with the oldest Comet Goldfish living for 43 years! This variance in estimates often leads to apprehension in buying these pets. I built this application to provide more definite life span predictions and solve this issue; While Comet Goldfish lifespans are still incredibly volatile, I hope this project offers more concrete estimates.
